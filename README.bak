# cf-nodejs-dashboard

This application has been developed to interact with some components of the <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/" target="_blank">Cloud foundry Architecture</a>: <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/cloud-controller.html" target="_blank">Cloud Controller</a>, <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/uaa.html" target="_blank">UAA</a> & <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/streaming-logs.html" target="_blank">Metrics</a> services installed in a <a href="https://www.cloudfoundry.org/" target="_blank">Cloud Foundry</a> Instance. Cloud Foundry offers a <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli" target="_blank">CLI</a> to manage a app life cycle in combination with the Web apps provided by the commercial Cloud Foundry platforms as <a href="https://run.pivotal.io/" target="_blank">PWS</a> or <a href="https://console.ng.bluemix.net/" target="_blank">Bluemix</a>. This Web App allows the user create the app, uploads the code and execute the typical actions (Start, Stop, Restage, Remove, Scale)

## Getting Started.

The application is able to run in localhost or hosted. To test in local, the steps are:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/prosociallearnEU/cf-nodejs-dashboard.git

``` json
var appOptions = {
    name: appName,
    space_guid: space_guid,
    instances: 1,
    memory: 256,
    disk_quota: 256,

};
```

The page will create a new application and this action will associate a new route with the name of the app.
